## Summary
This skill required the wiring of two fobs that use IR to communicate with each other. Both fobs were dientical to each other, and contain an IR LED, an IR receiver, and a transmitter (along with a button and LEDs). The button on the fob controlled which LED was lit up, and this data was then sent to the second fob so that it could mimic the LED state of the first fob. Since identical code was built on both fobs, the button on each could contorl the other.
