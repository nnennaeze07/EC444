## Summary
This skill did not require actual coding, just producing psuedocode based on a finite state model of a wahck-a-mole game. In my particular sttae model, I have two main states: the "mole showing" state and the "mole not showing" state. The different transisions are also showin in an FSM table. Several transitions from one state to another include when the game/timer starts, when the mole is hit/missed, and when the game/timer ends. In the psuedocode, each state is represented by a function, and then if sttaements are used in the main function to decide what actions determine what state is switched into.
