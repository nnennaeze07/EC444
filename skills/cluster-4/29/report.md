## Summary
This skill did not require any code, it was simply about how to protect the overall system of the remote car that will be used in the future. 

Identify weaknesses in your overall system (client, local network, internet, server, node.js, ESP32) with respect to security compromis:

Weaknesses in the system are based on the local network, internet, server, node.js and ESP32. In a person’s local network, it may be public
or lack the protection necessary to maintain control/ transfer data during a security attack. Node.js itself poses a security risk and is
open to attacks unless security measures are implemented. Last, the ESP32 connected over wifi can lead to more vulnerabilities. The ESP could 
be sent data that leads it to disconnect or crash from the system.



What ways can a bad guy attack your specific system? – list at least five and be very specific


Describe ways that you can overcome these attacks – in what ways can you mitigate these issues?
