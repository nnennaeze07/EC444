#  Skill 7: GPIO Pins

## Summary
The skill required the use of more GPIO pins, in order to make four LEDs light up. The LEDs were attached to pins A0,A1,A5, and 13 (which is also connected to the onboard LED). I learned in this skill that pins A2-A4 were solely input pins, and would not work with the LEDs (but worked later on thwn using the pushbutton). The code also contained a function to count in binary.
