## Summary
In this skill the servo motor was used. The goal of this skill was to make the servo rotate from 0 degrees to 180 degrees, which is its maximum degree. After follwoing the example code provided from github, all that was needed was to change the maximum and minimum values in the for loops to rotate the servo. Ther servo was connected to the esp32 from 3V, ground, and pin M0.
