The program written for skill 9 builds off of the servo code provided in the github repo (link below). Segments of the provided code were modified to make the servo rotate from its minimum to maximum angle: from -90 to +90 or 180 degrees. This was done by modifying the servo's minimum pulsewidth and maximum pulsewidth. In my program, the minimum pulsewidth was changed to 500 and the maximum pulsewidth changed to 2300.
