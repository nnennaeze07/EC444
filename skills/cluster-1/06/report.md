## Summary
This skill required the use of GPIO pins in order toggle the on board LED, as well as the use of scanf statements in order to read user input. When the user presses s, the code will switch between three different modes: toggle mode, echo mode, and dec to hex echo mode. By using scanf, I was able to accept user input and print it back out onto the terminal. In order to convert from decimal to hex, I simply used %X when printing to the terminal.
