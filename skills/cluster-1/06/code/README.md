In skill 6 I was able to use a switch program with three cases that represented three modes: toggle mode, echo mode, and dec to hex mode. The toggle mode toggles the LED when the user presses 't', the echo mode simply prints out what the user inputs, and the last mode converts the integer enterred by the user into a hexadecimal using %X. Modes are switched between by pressing 's'.
