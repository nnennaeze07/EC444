## Summary
In this skill, the program uses a timer, as well as code for the alphadisplay from skill 8. The timer wraps around (going from 00 to 99 and back to 00 again), and this is what is displayed on the alphanumeric display. It was not difficult to work with the display, however the timer was a bit difficult. Printing each number onto the display required that timer the timer be interrupted every second in order to retrieve the current "time" or value. In addition to this, the timer needed to be reloaded (which cane be done automatically with a function) once it needs to be wrapped around again.
