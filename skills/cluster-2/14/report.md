## Summary
In skill 14, an ultrasonic sesnor was incorporated into the wiring of the circuit. This adc pin was also used for this skill, and an equation to turn this reading into (something??) was used. This equation was found in the documentation for the sensor. Once this was calculated, it was printed onto the console.
