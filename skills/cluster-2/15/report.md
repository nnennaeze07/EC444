## Summary
In skill 15, an infrared sensor was incorporated into the wiring of the circuit. This adc pin was also used for this skill, and an equation to turn this reading into centimeters was used. This skill, unlike the others, required that voltage be calcultaed in order to then find the distance in centimeters. Once this was calculated, it was printed onto the console.
