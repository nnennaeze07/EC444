# Code Readme

This code folder contains "skill12.c", as well as code for the i2cdisplay, which is mentioned in the header of skill12.c. This was done so that the code for skill 12 did not have to include all of the code from the i2cdisplay to make the alphanumeric display show the voltage number. Rather than rewriting all of that code, we can include add "#include i2cdisplay.c".
