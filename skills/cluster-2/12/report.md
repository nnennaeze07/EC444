## Summary
In this skill, adc was introduced. I worked with a 5 volt battery and adc pins on the esp32 to read the voltage. Although an output of 5 volts was used, a voltage divider was wired to lower that voltage. The voltage (both input and output) were displayed on the console. The output voltage was also displayed on the alphanumeric display.
