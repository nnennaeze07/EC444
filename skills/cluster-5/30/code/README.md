# Code Readme

The code uploaded fulfills skill 30, and is slightly based off of example code provided from the official espressif github (from the folder "mcpwm_servo_control"). The code has two main parts: the function that controls the calibration of the ESC, and the function that controls the steering and speed. I set the test speed to be 1600, so that the car does not move too fast/too slow. For the steering, the max angle is set to 30 (for wheel testing), and the car is programmed to turn right, center, left, and then center again.  More information on this code, its references, and the basis of the skill it fulfills can be found on the report.md of skill 30.
