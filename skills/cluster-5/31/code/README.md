# Code Readme

The code uploaded fulfills skill 31, and is slightly based off of previous code written for the accelerometer in skill 23 (from my folder "cluster-4/skill23"). For quest 5, the contents of this code will likely be added to the esc and steering code programmed in skill 30, so that the car will be able to detect objects in its path and move around them  while maintaing constant speed. More information on this code, its references, and the basis of the skill it fulfills can be found on the report.md of skill 31.
